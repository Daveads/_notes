**war of art** // am not reading that


## RESISTANCE
* resistance is a force of nature 
* resistance never sleep and fear doesn't go away

**CODE:: THE BATTLE MUST BE FOUGHT ANEW EVERYDAY**


## Rational thought

```
The Greeks’ greatest poet understood that genius did not reside within his
fallible, mortal self—but came to him instead from some source that he
could neither command nor control, only invoke.
```

**the deeper the source we work from, the better our stuff will be and the more tranformative it will be for us and for those we share it with.**


## Friends and Family

THOUGHTS**

**so true, the last thing anyone would want is to remain as they are**


## OUR ALLIES 

1. Stupidity
2. Stubbornness
3. Blind faith
4. Passion
5. Assistance (the opposite of Resistance)
6. Friends and family


**STAY STUPID**

```
A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. It’s only you and I, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate.

```

* Don't think act **We can always revise and revisit once we’ve acted. But we can accomplish**
nothing until we act.



**Be Stubborn**

One we commit to action, the worst thing we can do is stop. 
/** stubborness keeps us for stopping **/

```
we will sink our junkyard-dog teeth into resistance's ass and not let go, no matter how hard he kicks.

```


**BLIND FAITH**

```
Our mightiest ally (our indispensable ally) is belief
in something we cannot see, hear, touch, taste, or
feel.

```

Imagine a box with a lid. Hold the box in your hand. Now open it.

What’s inside?

**with unshakeable faith that there will always be something in the box.**


**PASSION**

* fear saps passion


**Friends and Family**

// This part seems very important

```

When art and inspiration and success and fame and money have come and
gone, who still loves us—and whom do we love?


**Only two things will remain with us across the river: our inhering genius and the hearts we love.**

what we do and whom we do it for. ?

```

Chapter 1

**BEGINNING**


*Start before you are ready*

 - don't prepare begin
 
```
 our enemy is not lack of preparation;
 it’s not the difficulty of the project or the state of the
 marketplace or the emptiness of our bank account.

```

 The enemy is the resistance. **The enemy is our chatting brain**
 
 
 when we start before we are ready we show *huevos* , our blood heats up, courage begets more courae.
 
 **Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness.**
 
```
 Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation),
 there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless
 ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits
 oneself, then Providence moves too.

```

**Goethe’s couplets: “Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.” Begin it now.**




## A Research Diet

* Research can become Resistance. We want to work, not prepare to work.

1. stay primitive:

		The creative act is primitive. Its principles are of birth and genesis.
		
		"""
		Babies are born in blood and chaos; stars and
		galaxies come into being amid the release of massive
		primordial cataclysms.
		"""
		
		
		* it better to be primitive than to be sophisticated, and better to be stupid than smart.
		
		"""
		The most highly cultured mother gives birth
        sweating and dislocated and cursing like a sailor.
		
		"""
		
		That’s the place we inhabit as artists and innovators. It’s the place we must become comfortable with.
		
		
		**The hospital room may be spotless and sterile, but birth itself will always take place amid chaos, pain ,and blood.**
		

2. Swing for the seats

		* dont work small

		"""
		Start playing from power. We can always dial it back later. If we don’t
		swing for the seats from the start, we’ll never be able to drive a fastball into
		the upper deck.
		"""
		
3. Lunch with my Mentor
		
		* don't overthink
		* don't overprepare
		* Don’t let research become Resistance.
		* Don’t spend six months compiling shits*

		Discipline yourself to boil down your story/new business/philanthropic enterprise to a single page.
		
		
		
4. How Leonardo Did It

		1. Supper table stretching across the width of the canvas.
		2. Jesus standing in the center, apostles arrayed in various postures left and right.	
		3. Perspective and background tailing off behind.

		*That’s all Mr. Da V needed to start. The rest is details.*
		
		
## **That’s Why They Call It Rewriting**

```
There is no such thing as writing, only rewriting. 

```

**Get your idea down on paper. you can always tweak it later**


## start at the end

E.g.
		* focus on the users experience
		* major required features
		
**If you’re preparing a seduction, determine the state of mind you want the process of romancing to bring your lover to.**


		"""
		Figure out where you want to go; then work
		backwards from there.
		"""

## Thoughts and Chatter

Chatter:
when you shift your consciousness to a witnessing mode and to watch thoughts arise, float across your awareness, and then drift away, to be replaced by the next thought and the thought after that.

```
Don’t think : according the writers means don’t listen to the chatter. Pay no attention to those rambling, disjointed images and notions that drift across the movie screen of your mind.

```

chatter == resistance


**Ready to Rock and Roll**

1. Stay primitive.
2. Trust the soup.
3. Swing for the seats.
4. Be ready for Resistance.


Chapter 2


## The Universe is not indifferent

when we decide to crate anything----------science, tech or to advance in the direction of a higher , nobler version of ourselves, we uncork from the universe, ineluctably, an equal and opposite reaction.

That reaction is Resistance 

"""
Resistance is an active, intelligent, protean malign force---tireless, relentles whose sole object is to stop us from becoming our best selves and from achieving our higher goals.
"""

**The universe is not indifferant. it is actively hostile.**

```
We can never eliminate Resistance. It will never
go away. But we can outsmart it, and we can enlist
allies that are as powerful as it is.

```

**One thing not permited to do is take resistance lightly**



## FILL IN THE GAPS

"""
Any project or enterprise can be broken down into
beginning, middle, and end. Fill in the gaps; then fill
in the gaps between the gaps.
"""


## Cover the Canvas

"""
One rule for first full working drafts: get them
done ASAP.
"""

**Don’t worry about quality. Act, don’t reflect. Momentum is everything.**

Get the first version of your project done from A to Z as fast as you can.


## Suspend All Self-Judgment

**Unless you’re building a sailboat or the Taj Mahal, I give you a free pass to screw up as much as you like.**
//This seems more like software


"""
Only one thing matters in this initial draft: get SOMETHING done,
however flawed or imperfect.
""" 

perfectionism == "resistance"
